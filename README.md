# Dynamic Surroundings 
This is NOT the minecraft mod. This is a mod similar to it for the vr game Blade & Sorcery

For Blade & Sorcery version 9.3

# Buidling the DLL
To actually compile this, you'll probably need to change the build event to output to your Blade & Sorcery install path. Other than that, it should be all set up and ready to go.

If you want to update this to newer versions of the game, or make your own version, go ahead. But this mod should be maintained for a long time.
